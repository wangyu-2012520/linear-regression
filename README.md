# linear-regression
This linear-regression implementation includes 1) Linear regression with one variable 2) Linear regression with multiple variables.

Linear regression with one variable implementation uses Gradient Descent. 

Linear regression with multiple variables implementation uses Feature Normalization, Gradient Descent / Normal Equations. 

Also both implementation use "surf" and "contour" commands to Visualizing cost function.
