# linear-regression
This small exercise / experiment is targeted to: 
- linear regression with one variable 
- linear regression with multiple variables.

Machine learning technique used in this small exercise: 
- linear regression with one variable implementation uses Gradient Descent. 
- linear regression with multiple variables implementation uses Feature Normalization, Gradient Descent / Normal Equations. 
- both implementation use "surf" and "contour" commands to visualizing cost function.
